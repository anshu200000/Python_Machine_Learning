# flutter_task_manager
🔹 How the App Works Step by Step App starts → TaskProvider is created → empty task list. User taps “Fetch Tasks” → API call → first 10 tasks from JSONPlaceholder loaded. User types a task &amp; presses Add → task added locally + sent to API. User taps Delete → task removed from local state + API. UI automatically updates.
